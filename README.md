This project is dedicated to visualizing various aspects of Canadian literature from 1769 to 1964. Through a series of interactive charts and graphs, we aim to provide insights into the trends, patterns, and characteristics of literary works during this period.

The visualizations are built using modern web technologies and libraries, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience. We hope that these visualizations will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, students, and enthusiasts of Canadian literature.
